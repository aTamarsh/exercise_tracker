This Exercise Tracker Web App was built using the **MERN** stack as a Single Page Application.
The web app tracks exercises completed by the user.

I used React for the front-end UI portion of the app. 
I wrote a REST API using Node and Express for the back-end web service along with MongoDB for persistence.

This app was designed for fitness enthusiasts who need a quick way of logging their daily exercises to monitor
over time.

### Running this app
