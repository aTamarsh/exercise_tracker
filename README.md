This Exercise Tracker Web App was built using the **MERN** stack as a Single Page Application.
The web app tracks exercises completed by the user.

I used React for the front-end UI portion of the app. 
I wrote a REST API using Node and Express for the back-end web service along with MongoDB for persistence.

### Running this app

Go to the root directory, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` to start the applications.
